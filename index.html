  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I have always been interested in technology, and I first started learning about computer science in middle school. Since then, I have taken several computer science classes in high school, and I have also participated in coding clubs and competitions. Some of the programming languages I have learned include Python, Java, and C++. My goal is to continue learning and exploring computer science in college, and eventually pursue a career in this field.</p>
